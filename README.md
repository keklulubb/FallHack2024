# Time Travel Car Game

## Overview

**Time Travel Car Game** is a 2D arcade game where you control a flying car that navigates through time portals. Each time portal represents a different time period, with unique gravity and physics(hopefully). The goal is to fly through these portals, add progress to the completion bar, and advance to the next level. As you progress, the game will change time periods, each with distinct challenges.

## Gameplay

- **Objective**: Guide the flying car through time portals to fill the completion bar. Once the bar is full, you advance to the next level with different gravity settings and new challenges.
- **Controls**: Use the spacebar or the up arrow key to make the car jump/fly upward.
- **Time Periods**: Each level represents a different time period (e.g., present, past, future), with unique backgrounds, music, gravity, and obstacles.

## Features

- **Flying Car**: Control a flying car to pass through the obstacles.
- **Dynamic Time Portals**: Navigate through different time portals as obstacles, each level representing one time period.
- **Completion Bar**: Track the progress with a bar that fills up as the player successfully navigate portals.
- **Challenging Levels**: Each level introduces new time periods with altered gravity, backgrounds, and game physics.
